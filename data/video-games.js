Basically the idea of the game was to make some sort of 3D metroidvania where the main player capacity is to "throw" some kind of weapon and call it back. Another important mechanic is the ability to "teleport" where the weapon is. That way you get a mix of dynamic combat and puzzle possibilities (as shown in the video below). I've worked on this game for a few weeks in my free time in summer 2023 and reused it in class for a level design exercice around january 2024.`
