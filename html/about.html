                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Hi there ! I'm a french student, currently in internship at TavroxGames in Toulouse. I enjoy making video games and programming in general. I'm a Doctor Who fan, a Percy Jackson reader and a Life Is Strange player. Writing stories and learning are two big aspects of my life and I think that both these things can mix in video games and that's something I really want to convey in what I do.</p><br>    
                <p>I started making video games when I was eleven on RPG Maker (pokemon fan games precisely) and it was wonderful. For a while it was a big hobby and everytime I had access to my dad's computer I would try and make maps, put more stuff on my tilesets, animate my characters or try and modify the code (which was ruby) as well as I could. This made me discover Photoshop and it quickly also became a hobby.</p><br>
                <p>In high school I started using Unity trying to make a pokemon 3D game (which is sort of a fixation by now right ?). This led to me discovering C4D and trying my hand at 3D modeling and so. Later on, when I had to choose what I wanted to do in life and what I would study, I had the sudden revelation that I indeed wanted to make video games. And most of all that it was possible.</p><br>
                <p>So here I am now, really, really making video games and learning to at school. Oh by the way, my name is Alvina Damasio--Razafiarizaka (Damasio, portuguese, father's side, Razafiarizaka, malagasy, mother's side) and I'm from France, Périgueux, a little city two hours away from Bordeaux. And I still think about making a pokemon game from time to time.</p><br>
