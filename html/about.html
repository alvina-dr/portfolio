                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Hi there ! I'm a french student, working part time at TavroxGames in Toulouse. I enjoy making video games and programming in general. Big Doctor Who and Percy Jackson fan, I also love playing narrative video games such as Life Is Strange, Disco Elysium or Detroit Become Human. Writing stories and learning are two big aspects of my life and I think that both these things can mix in video games and that's something I really want to convey in what I do.</p><br>    
                <p>I started making video games when I was eleven on RPG Maker (Pokemon fan games precisely) and it was wonderful. For a while it was a big hobby and everytime I had access to my dad's computer I would try and make maps, put more stuff on my tilesets, animate my characters or try and modify the code (which was ruby) as well as I could. This made me discover Photoshop and it quickly also became a hobby.</p><br>
                <p>In high school I started using Unity trying to make a Pokemon 3D game (which is sort of a fixation by now right ?). This led to me discovering C4D and trying my hand at 3D modeling and so. Later on, when I had to choose what I wanted to do in life and what I would study, I had the sudden revelation that I indeed wanted to make video games. And most of all that it was possible.</p><br>
                <p>So here I am now, really, really making video games and learning to at school. Oh by the way, my name is Alvina Damasio--Razafiarizaka (Damasio, Portuguese, father's side, Razafiarizaka, Malagasy, mother's side) and I'm from France, Périgueux, a little city two hours away from Bordeaux. And I still think about making a Pokemon game from time to time.</p><br>

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>I studied in Bordeaux for two years and got my Diploma of Higher Education in Multimedia and Internet. Then I started a Vocational Degree about video games and interactive media in Tarbes, while working in Toulouse. I later entend to continue with a master in video game programming, hopefully at ENJMIN in Angoulême (wink wink).</p><br>    
            <p>Here are my English and French curriculum. Don't worry, no download it opens in a blank page :D</p><br>
