                <p>We had to write short stories once during our DipHE and I decided to make mine about the judgement of the creator of a deadly virus that spread around the universe. Surrounded by a council he has to answer to the crowd for his mistakes. Here you can see him in a glass cage. Thing is, you need to take a step back because the virus is humanity, the defendant and all his peers are "gods" in the sense that they created us.</p><br>
                <p>Anyway, I had a lot of fun writing this story, although it fell on the same week as the eloquence contest of my school for which I had to put up a speech. It was frustrating because I love writing and I had to do all of this in a rush. This image was done with a mix of Twinmotion and photoshop.</p><br>

                <p>It all came down to this "idea" : the milky way. That would be a funny brand name if we ever wanted to export our milk through the galaxy. For this one I made the graphics on Photoshop and then modelised the bottle on C4D. Then I imported all of this in Twinmotion, prepared a little scene and rendered two versions : one blue, one red. I just couldn't pick !</p><br>
