            <p>For our end of the year project (<span class="text-highlight">master 1st year</span>), we had the idea to make a sort of <span class="text-highlight">mix between Spiderman and Shadow of the Colossus</span>. In other words, a really <span class="text-highlight">dynamic controller</span> and <span class="text-highlight">huge creatures to take down quickly</span>.</p>
            <p>We had <span class="text-highlight">three months</span> to make the game with a <span class="text-highlight">team of seven</span>. We were <span class="text-highlight">two programmers</span>, and while I was working full time on the project, the other dev could only be there half of the time as they were working on two games.</p>
            <p>At first, <span class="text-highlight">I mainly took charge of the whole gameplay (character controller, critical path, UI)</span> while the other programmer did the procedural animation and the enemy movement. Then <span class="text-highlight">once all the basics were set up, we shared the rest of the workload and used this rough base to polish the movement gamefeel together</span>.</p>
            <div class="div-row" style="width: 100%; height: 30rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/envc8_SKGg4?si=FSxHPLorRDLAoSTd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>This game used <span class="text-highlight">physics</span> much more than any other game I had done before and led to lots of pretty complex actions. The first thing to design was the swinging part.</p>
            <h3>Swinging</h3>
            <p>For this part, I first tried to <span class="text-highlight">look into what Spiderman actually does</span>. One of the big questions I had, was how do we know <span class="text-highlight">which point to use to swing</span>. After searching a bit on the internet I found this conference that at some point explains how the developers of Spiderman themselves got inspired by <a class="link-in-text" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/378070/Energy_Hook/" target="_blank">Energy Hook</a>'s way of doing things : <a class="link-in-text" href="https://youtu.be/5T1hnau158M?si=UZ7K8-DZiZsFD34D" target="_blank">Classic Game Design Postmortem: Swinging with Spider-Man (GDC)</a>.</p>
            <div class="div-row" style="width: 100%;">
                <div style="width: 49%;">

                    <p><i>Swinging with Spider-man (GDC)</i></p>
                </div>
                <div style="width: 49%;">
                    <img src="../../../img/video-games/nadir/ngh-grapple-detection.png" style="width: 100%;margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <p><i>Our documentation about the swinging behavior</i></p>
                </div>
            </div> 
            <p>Basically, what they did is they <span class="text-highlight">trace a cone of raycast that detects all the possible hanging points</span>. In Energy Hook, <span class="text-highlight">the cone expands the longer the input to swing is held</span>, in order to catch more possible points. At first, we decided to go with something pretty similar and just <span class="text-highlight">trace a cone of raycast</span>. If a raycast hits something, it <span class="text-highlight">saves the collided object and the point of collision</span> in a list. Once all collisions have been saved, we then calculate the distance between each one and a defined point that we call <span class="text-highlight">"perfect swinging point"</span> - which the game designers can move around to influence how we want our average swing curve to feel like. <span class="text-highlight">The point that the player will use to swing is the one that's the closest to our perfect swinging point</span>.</p>
            <p><i><span class="text-highlight">Side note :</span> Since in our game the player would be able to grapple at moving objects like the enemies, we needed to save not only the position but also the object that we wanted to connect with. That way we make our hanging point a children of the object we want to use to swing - and it will follow the movement of its parent.</i></p>
            <p>The thing is - as explained in the conference - if you only do one simple cone raycast then you miss lots of opportunities to grapple at stuff in the environment. For example, you might <span class="text-highlight">miss the ceiling right above your head since it's in the middle of the cone</span>. That's why Energy Hook's system is so interesting, if your <span class="text-highlight">cone raycast don't detect anything, its radius expands</span> and you get to look at a wider area. Since the cone starts with a really small radius you catch all the points near the ceiling WHILE also being able to catch hanging points on the sides if you have nothing above your head. That way we include many more possibilities.</p>
            <p>At first that's what we did. But after a few weeks of playing around with the character controller, <span class="text-highlight">something just felt off</span>. 
            The thing with this technique is that we actually <span class="span text-highlight">still might miss a lot of more interesting points</span>. Since the cone grows with time, if we detect a point right above the player's head, that's the point we will immediatly grapple. The distance check with the perfect point is only calculated for a given radius AND if nothing is returned, THEN the radius grows. That means that <span class="text-highlight">if we detect at least a point at the minimum radius, we won't even bother checking all the other possible radius</span>.</p>
            <p>The problem is that in our case, a point detected near the ceiling might not be closer to the perfect point than a point taken on the right of the player (for example).</p>

                </div>
            </div> 
            <p>Now, in our game we had two raycast cone like this, which means that calculation done every frame was huge. To help with <span class="text-highlight">performance</span>, what we did was to <span class="text-highlight">divide this calculation on several frames</span> instead of just one. The calculation of the swinging point would be less precise but we would get more FPS.</p>
            <p>The cone raycast had parameters like following : <br>
            <span class="text-highlight">Angle precision</span> : The <span class="text-highlight">number of raycast in a circle</span> => for example we could do a 360 raycast circle if we want a lot of precision - one per degree - or only 90 if we want to have more performance.<br>
            <span class="text-highlight">Minimum Radius</span> : The minimum size of the cone radius, at which the cone starts when the player tries to swing.<br>
            <span class="text-highlight">Maximum Radius</span> : The maximum size of the cone radius, reached if the swing input is not released for some times.<br>
            <span class="text-highlight">Raycast Length</span> : This parameter was not in the ConeRaycast script but in the swinging parameters (in the player data). Still, it was a really important variable for the cone behavior.<br>
            <span class="text-highlight">Radius Precision</span> : The number of step between the Minimum Radius and the Maximum Radius. The higher it is, the more precise the collision detection will be, but it will also cost more performance.</p>
            <h3>Interaction</h3>
            <p>In Nadir the player can interact with three types of "spots" when they are close enough. The enemis' weak spot, the dash spot and the bumpers. </p>
            <p>Nadir is a gamepad first game, with fully remappable inputs.</p>
            <p>Since we wanted to participate to the Busan Indie Connect Festival, I set up the Unity Localization System on the project. That way the game was playable in English, French and Korean.</p>
