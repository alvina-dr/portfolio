            <p><i>Explore and defend your mine against waves of monsters in this innovative roguelike survival game ! Collect and manage your resources, discover buildings with unique effects and unleash mighty heroes to hold monsters out of the mine until the sun rises.</i></p>
            <p>I was able to work on Hold The Mine during my internship at <a class="link-in-text" href="https://www.hookariagames.com/" target="_blank">Hookaria Games</a> (to learn more about the internship, you can read this article : <a class="link-in-text" href="/html/blog/hookaria-games-internship.html">02.09.2025 - Hookaria Games Internship</a>)</p>

            <p>Basically, Hold The Mine is composed of two phases, night and day. During the day you mine blocks to find resources, create buildings, discover new heroes and unlock their powers. During the night itâ€™s a battle for survival against hordes of enemies ! You can help your heroes by unleashing special abilities given by some buildings. Your goal is to survive through ten nights !</p>

            <p>The game was mainly developed by Morgan Seurre (programming, art, design). He is a former colleague from Blanket Games aaaand was my boss for the last six months. In addition to Morgan, three different freelancers stepped in at different stages of the production.</p>
            <p>First there was Jeanne Prigent, which I also had the chance to work with at Blanket Games (<a class="link-in-text" href="/html/projects/video-games/overboss.html">Overboss</a>, <a class="link-in-text" href="/html/projects/video-games/rolling-food-chain.html">Creeping Deck</a>, <a class="link-in-text" href="/html/projects/video-games/protectors-of-pomelo.html">Protectors of Pomelo</a>). She is a 2D game artist and animator (<a class="link-in-text" href="/html/blog/hookaria-games-internship.html">https://jeanneprigent.wordpress.com/</a>). Camille Coq has also worked on the animation part of the game (<a class="link-in-text" href="/html/blog/hookaria-games-internship.html">https://camillecee.weebly.com/</a>). And finally, Antoine Zakrzewski aka Zakku made the sound and music, like on <a class="link-in-text" href="/html/projects/video-games/rolling-food-chain.html">Rolling Food Chain</a> (<a class="link-in-text" href="/html/blog/hookaria-games-internship.html">https://bento.me/zakku</a>).</p>
            <p>I was not working full time on the game at all, I was more of a support here and there. My help mainly consisted in programming and a little bit of design brainstorming. I had to add content : hero and power integration, gamefeel, UI animations, achievement system, also gave a bit of help on a recursive algorithm linked to pathfinding, etcâ€¦</p>
            <p>I think Hold The Mine is really great and has a lot of potential, I just can't wait to see the final result ! To support the game, you can <a class="link-in-text" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164960/Hold_The_Mine/" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam !</a></p>
